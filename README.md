### the process of thought

.Each Hame of the bowling has 2 tries
. Each turn has 2 tries
. if you dont hit all the pins then your score is the total number of your pins added
. if you don't hit then pins in the 2nd turn then your score is the 10 pins plus the pins in the next role
. if you hit all the pins then the score is 10 pins plus the score of the 2 rolls
